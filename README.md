# Big Bang Theory

The game is minesweeper type:
When you click on a box, sell a number that identifies many personajes around:
Be careful because you have a box that has a hidden hypothesis, you will lose.
If you think you have the certainty that there is a personaje, click on the length on the box to point it out.
Do not click on a length in a box where there is not a personaje because you will lose. You win once you have found all the personajes.
